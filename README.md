### CS1D Project 2
*Your agile team is to write an application that stores the given National Football League (NFL) information into an ordered or unordered map (not using the map or unordered map STL or the QT map). The underlying data structure of the map is the choice of the team. The map should store either the stadiums and/or the souvenirs. The application will allow football fans to plan their dream vacation.*
